0.8
  * Adding support for CRC hash method 

0.7 Tue Oct 30 09:24:05 PDT 2007
  * Poved to poll() from select()
  * Fixes in internal string class for allocation of large numbers of
    strings.
  * memcached_mget() function now sends keys as it parses them instead of
    building strings as it goes.
  * Propper flush now for making sure we get all IO sent even when in
    non-block mode.
  * Added --enable-debug rule for configure
  * All asserts() removed (hey this is going into production!)


0.6 Wed Oct 17 08:41:35 PDT 2007
  * get value returns are now null terminated (request by Cal Heldenbrand) 
  * Fixed connections for more hosts then two.
  * Rewrite of the read/write IO systems to handle different sorts of host
    failures.
  * Added man pages for all functions and tools
  * Raised buffer size for readinng/writing to 16K
  * You can now optionally set the socket size for recv/send via 
    memached_behavior_set/get.

0.5 Tue Oct  9 00:22:25 PDT 2007
 * Ruby maintainer mentioned TCP_NODELAY patch he had added. Added this to C
   library as well. (Eric Hodel drbrain@segment7.net)
  * Added support script for set_benchmark
  * Updated memslap to allow testing of TCP_NODELAY
  * Updated memslap to support --flush (aka dump memcache servers before
    testing)
  * Fixed bug in multiple hosts not being activated
  * Added environmental variable MEMCACHED_SERVERS which can be used to 
    set the servers list.
  * fixed memcached_stat method (and now memstat works)
  * server connect now happens on demand.
  * Help for all command line applications

0.4 Wed Oct  3 10:28:50 PDT 2007
  * Added buffered IO to write calls for keys
  * Added buffered IO for reads
  * memstat was broken (bad if/else on connect)
  * New non-blocking IO (not default yet). Mucho faster
  * Refactor of test system.
  * memslap crash solved

0.3 Mon Oct  1 06:37:52 PDT 2007
  * Jeff Fisher <guppy@techmonkeys.org> provided a spec file
  * Added "make rpm" around dist file
  * Added support for Solaris
  * Added support for DTrace
  * Fixed read to be recv and write to be send
  * Bug fix where memstat would core if no server was found
  * Added memslap tool (load generator)
  * Numerous bug fixes in library
  * Added calls to library for creating host lists (see
    text cases to understand how to use this).

0.2 Thu Sep 27 03:46:57 PDT 2007
  * First public version
