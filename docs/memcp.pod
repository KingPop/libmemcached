=head1 NAME

memcp - Copies files to a collection of memcached servers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

memcp [options] file file <servers>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

memcp operates similar to the standard unix cp command. Files will be stored
in the collection of memcached servers specified. Key names will be based on
the name of the file (which does not include its directory path).

You can specify servers via the --servers option or memcat will use the
environmental variable MEMCACHED_SERVERS. If you specify neither of these
memcp will expect that the final value in the list passed to it is the name
of a server(s).

For a full list of its operations run the tool with the --help option.
