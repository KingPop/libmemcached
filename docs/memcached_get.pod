C Client Library for memcached (libmemcached, -lmemcached)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #include <memcached.h>

  char *memcached_get (memcached_st *ptr,
                       char *key, size_t key_length,
                       size_t *value_length, 
                       uint16_t *flags,
                       memcached_return *error);

  memcached_return
    memcached_mget (memcached_st *ptr, 
                    char **keys, size_t *key_length, 
                    unsigned int number_of_keys);

  char *memcached_fetch (memcached_st *ptr,
                         char *key, size_t *key_length, 
                         size_t *value_length,
                         uint16_t *flags, 
                         memcached_return *error);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

memcached_get() is used to fetch an individual value from the server. You
must pass in a key and its length to fetch the object. You must supply
three pointer variables which will give you the state of the returned
object.  A uint16_t pointer to contain whatever flags you stored with the value,
a size_t pointer which will be filled with size of of the object, and a
memcached_return pointer to hold any error. The object will be returned
upon success and NULL will be returned on failure. 

memcached_mget() is used to select multiple keys at once. For multiple key
operations it is always faster to use this function. This function always
works asynchronously. memcached_fetch() is then used to retrieve any keys
found. No error is given on keys that are not found.

memcached_fetch() is used to fetch an individual value from the server. 
memcached_mget() must always be called before using this method.  You
must pass in a key and its length to fetch the object. You must supply
three pointer variables which will give you the state of the returned
object.  A uint16_t pointer to contain whatever flags you stored with the value,
a size_t pointer which will be filled with size of of the object, and a
memcached_return pointer to hold any error. The object will be returned
upon success and NULL will be returned on failure. 

=head1 RETURN

All objects returned must be freed by the calling application.
memcached_get() and memcached_fetch() will return NULL on error. You must
look at the value of error to determine what the actual error was.
