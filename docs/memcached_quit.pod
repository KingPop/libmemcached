=head1 NAME

memcached_quit

=head1 LIBRARY

C Client Library for memcached (libmemcached, -lmemcached)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

#include <memcached.h>
void memcached_quit(memcached_st *ptr);

=head1 DESCRIPTION


memcached_quit() will disconnect you from all currently connected servers.
It will also reset the state of the connection (aka any memcached_fetch you
are in the middle of will be terminated). This function is called
automatically when you call memcached_free() on the memcached_st structure.

You do not need to call this on your own. All operations to change server
hashes and parameters will handle connections to the server for you. This
function is provided mainly so that you can timeout your connections or
reset connections during the middle of a memcached_fetch().

=head1 RETURN

memcached_quit() returns memcached_return. The value on success will be MEMCACHED_SUCCESS. For all errors check with memcached_strerror().
