Hi!

So what is this? Its a library in C for connectinng to memcached servers
(http://danga.com/memcached/). It is also a collection of utilities designed
to work with memcached.

memcat - Copy the value of a key to standard output
memflush - Flush the contents of your servers.
memrm - Remove a key(s) from the serrver.
memstat - Dump the stats of your servers to standard output
memslap - Load generation utility (benchmark!)

The utilities are alpha quality at this point. The library is in production
in many locations (upwards to 600 nodes).

Want to contribute? If you write more then three good patches, then I will
just ask you to commit directly to the tree. I am happy to have additional
people work on this project.

If you are looking for answers to your questions please check out the
